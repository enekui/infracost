## InfraCost Demo

Infracost enables a shift-left approach for cloud costs by providing cost estimates for Terraform before deployment. Additionally, it can check for FinOps best practices in accordance with the Well-Architected Frameworks of cloud vendors, and your company's required tag keys/values. This not only saves your team money but also streamlines discussions about costs within the engineering workflow rather than it being a post-deployment consideration.
